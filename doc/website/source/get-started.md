title: Get Started

To get started with `flutter_test_goldens`, add the package to your pubspec.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test_goldens: any
```

With the packaged added, you may want to accomplish a variety of goals:

 * [Write a gallery test](/golden-scenes/gallery)
 * [Write a timeline test](/golden-scenes/filmstrip)
 * [Add focus and semantic tracking](/golden-metadata/payload)
