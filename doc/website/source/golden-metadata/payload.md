Every golden scene includes a metadata payload encoded within the image, which
tells `flutter_test_goldens` where to find each golden image, along with
other relevant data for verifying the test output.

The metadata is encoded within the PNG's `tEXt` property so that it's guaranteed to always
move with its associated golden pixels.
